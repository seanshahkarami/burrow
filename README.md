# Burrow

Burrow is one of my projects to help me explore [Gopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)) sites. As such, this a work in progress and meant to be a fun, experimental thing.

## Usage

1. Build the server. `go build`
1. Start the server. `./burrow`
2. Visit [the landing page](http://localhost:7070).
3. Have fun exploring!
